      <p>Welcome to Passageway, a project developed by four Computer Science
        students at Grand Valley State University. The goal of the project is
        to provide businesses or individuals with a simple way to monitor and
        visualize foot-traffic data on their property.</p>

      <p>Passageway is completely open-source! Check out our GitHub repository to learn more about how
        to get the ball rolling and integrate Passageway into your own project.
        We made our instructions as easy to follow as possible and we are
        continuing to refine the documentation.</p>
